# Knex Object
A powerful toolkit to use with Knex.js. Supporting decorators (ES2018, stage2), Entity Model, and so on.

## Install
```
npm install knex-object
```

## Decorators
Knex Object uses decorators of version ES2018+, Stage2 [Proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-decorators). Just to warn you, TypeScript's own implementation of decorators are different to JavaScript's. In order to use this library seemlessly, we recommend that you use Babel compiler, not the one of TypeScript (TSC).

## API
Will be discussed later.
